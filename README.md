# AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS

Hello, i made small script that giz clone airsim and then changes some files in airsm folder then builds it in MacOS.
I took files from this link : https://gist.github.com/klintan/be30a38aa14fc54706472f5b54beae0e (only this worked on my mac)

And other files i wrote by myself.


I wrote this because i had trouble installing Airsim on my computer and I wanted to help other devs.

Sorry for my english, if someone have time please correct README. 

<code>
git clone https://github.com/nfirbas/AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS.git
  
cd AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS

./run.sh
</code>
