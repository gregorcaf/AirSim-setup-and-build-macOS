# AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS

Hello, I made a small script that git clones AirSim, changes some files in AirSim folder and builds it in MacOS.
I took files from this link : https://gist.github.com/klintan/be30a38aa14fc54706472f5b54beae0e (only this worked on my mac)

Other files were written by me.

I wrote this due to trouble with installing AirSim on my computer and I wanted to help other developers.


``` 
  git clone https://github.com/nfirbas/AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS.git
  cd AirSim-setup-and-build-macOS
  ./run.sh
```
